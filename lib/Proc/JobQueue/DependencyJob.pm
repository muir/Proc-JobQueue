=head1 NAME

Proc::JobQueue::DependencyJob - job object for DependencyQueues

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Proc::JobQueue::DependencyJob;
 use Object::Dependency;

 $graph = Object::Dependency->new()

 $job = Proc::JobQueue::DependencyJob->new($graph, $callback_func, %params);

 $job->startup()

 $job->job_part_finished()

 $job->jobdone();

 $job->failure(@exit_code)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Proc::JobQueue::DependencyJob is a subclass of 
L<Proc::JobQueue::Job> used to define jobs to run from a 
L<Proc::JobQueue::DependencyQueue>.

DependencyJob jobs are perl objects with a callback API.  C<$job-E<gt>startup()> is
called to start the job.  That in turn calls, the callback provided in construction.  The
C<$job> object is added to the argument list for the callback.

The return value from the callback lets C<startup()> know what to do
next: the job is finished; the job finished but it remains a 
dependency in the dependency graph; the job is not done but it should
be removed from the dependency graph; or the job is not done and 
should remain in the dependency graph.

If the job is not done, then it needs to signal it's completion later
by calling C<$job-E<gt>finished(0)> or C<$job-E<gt>failure($reason)>.

=head1 CONSTRUCTION

These jobs require a dependency graph for construction.  The C<%params> 
parameter represents additional parameters passed to L<Proc::JobQueue::Job>.

=head1 METHODS

In addition to the methods in L<Proc::JobQueue::Job>, DependencyJob provides:

=over

=item startup()

This is called by C<Proc::JobQueue::Job::start()>.  It calls the 
callback.  The callback must return.  A reference to self (C<$job>)
is provided as an argument to the callback.
The return value from the callback must be a string from the following set:

=over

=item C<all-done>

The job has completed and the dependency in the dependency graph should
be removed.

=item C<all-keep>

The job has not completed and the dependency in the dependency graph should
be kept.

The job can be marked as done with:

 $job->job_part_finished($do_startmore)

The dependency can be marked as completed with:

 $job->{dependency_graph}->remove_dependency($job);

Or both the job and the dependency can be marked as done/completed with
one call:

 $job->finished(0);

=item C<job-done,dep-keep>

The job has completed, but it should not be removed from the dependency
graph.  Somehow the callback must arrange that the dependency graph
dependency gets removed later:

 $job->{dependency_graph}->remove_dependency($job);

=item C<job-keep,dep-done>

The job is not done, but the dependency has been been fullfilled.
The job can be marked done with:

 $job->finished(0);

Or 

 $job->job_part_finished($do_startmore)

Things which depend on this job are eligible to be started.

=back

=item failed()

This overrides L<JobQueue::Job>'s failure() method to mark the dependency as
stuck.

=item failure(@reason)

This marks this job as failed.
